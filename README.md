READ THIS FIRST!

1. I've set up the project using yarn, you might want to use it aswell. (using npm should be fine too)

2. Run yarn / npm i

3. Run yarn run dev / npm run dev to start project

4. You can see the app in localhost, it should be running fine.

5. I've prepared a training flow for you guys hold on tight:

<h1>HOW TO USE THIS REPO</h1>

Use CMD + SHIFT + F in VSCODE and look for "STEP 0" and do what it says then go on to "STEP 1" where you need to finish all subpoints, and then move on and so on.

After every step you should go back to the app and see how it changed.

<h4>BE CAREFULL TO BE WORKING IN THE "APP" directory and not the "SOLUTION" one <h2>
